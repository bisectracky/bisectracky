# About Me:
I am first year MSCS student at New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I am broadly interested in several topics, including Blockchain, Computer Music and Data-driven Recommender System. We are currently working on an NFT based Art socializing and trading game - "Road to Curators", which is estimated to be launched in South Korea and Japan around Christmas.
