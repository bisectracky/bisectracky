# About Me:
I am first year MSCS student at New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I am broadly interested in several topics, including applied Cryptography - Blockchain and Concensus (the field I earn for a living), Computer Music (the field I am mostly interested in) and Data-driven Recommender System (the field I once did research).
